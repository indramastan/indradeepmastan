<h1>A hearty Welcome! </h1>

<p>I have finished my Ph.D. from <a href="https://cs.iitgn.ac.in/students.html">CSE @ IIT Gandhinagar</a>, under the guidance of <a href="https://people.iitgn.ac.in/~shanmuga/">Dr. Shanmuganathan Raman</a>. I worked on Image Restoration and Image Synthesis using Deep Learning. 
  
Prior to Ph.D, I had wonderful experiences serving Hiddenreflex Bangalore and developing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_(web_browser)">Epic Privacy Browser</a>. Presently, I am working as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineer at LNMIIT Jaipur.  </p>

<p>I spent my most beautiful and crucial phase of life at IISC Bangalore. I pursued my M.E. from Computer Science and Automation Department @IISC. I did my thesis in the domain of financial cryptography, under the guidance of <a href="https://www.csa.iisc.ac.in/people/people-faculty-cevm.html">Dr. C. E. Veni Madhavan</a>. Also worked closely in the software engineering field as part of my undergraduate projects in MNIT jaipur.</p>

<p>Apart from working on academic projects, I enjoy dancing, sketching, cooking, and beatboxing. I have participated in multiple stage performances in my student life.</p>
